# FujiFish Chess
This is a  *Very EARLY* WIP chess server for Fujinet clients. It uses [StockFish](https://stockfishchess.org/)
as a Chess engine for single player games. I'm also using [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
to manage the chess board.



Supported Gaming Platforms:
* Atari 8-bit Computers
* MS-DOS (eventually)
